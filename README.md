# Solar-flare-class-prediction

In this project, we have used multilabel solar flare dataset, which is available on kaggle.

The dataset contains 6 CSV files: 3 files for training & 3 for testing.

We have precprocessed the data & created 5 classes for the class prediction.
 N --> No flare
 B --> weakest flare
 C --> weak flare
 M --> strong flare
 X --> strongest flare

We have implemented 4 Machine Learning Algorithms & 3 ensemble techniques in this project.

Machine Learning Algorithms & their accuracy:
1) Logistic regression :  0.773
2) K Nearest Neighbor : 0.87
3) Support Vector Classifier : 0.792
4) Decision tree :  0.829

Ensemble techniques & their accuracy:
5) RandomForest :  0.897
6) Adaptive boosting : 0.746
7) Gradient Boosting : 0.792
